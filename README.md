OpenCv Tutorial backup file. 

Working on making my sudoku solver able to take data from simple pictures
Don't mind this, just trying to get used to git and working on different computers.

Will probably redo this using the mnist dataset instead of my own training data
work fine with trained exemple
heh with pictures from outside the scope of the training

use run.py file to try it out, work fine with a majority of example found in v2 folders
